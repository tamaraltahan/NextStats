My plan on how this works:

    From the starting state, we ask the user to put in their OD ID
    after hitting submit we want to verify that we have the correct user, so we call a GET request to the OD API
    we get the player name from this API and prompt the user 'Is this the correct player: {their name}'

    afterwards the button should read "confirm" and when clicked again it will call my python script, or 
    I can rewrite in JS for the fun/exp of it which will be fine since all data is numerical until we get to charts/visualizing

    after the player confirms their request, the content of the whole page should be a loading animation with text updating
    depending on the stage of completion we're in.

    This will be accomplished through changing states every time a function call is finished - this can be accomplished
    by having a sentinal variable which changes state.

        preliminary mockup as follows:

        let getSomeData = () => {
            const [state, setState] = react.useState(0)

            function foo(){
                ...
                setState(state+1)
                return myData
            }
        }

        there should then be a list of messages corresponding to state, something like
        ['getting player data', 'parsing player matches', 'aquiring data on all players']
        and so on until we reach completion

    Now suppose this all works, we have all the data we wanted from the API, and done our shitty calculations

    we need to vizualize this data with simple picharts as a baseline - open to more types if I can come up with anything

    so from here we need to figure out how to either export the images from the python script into our webpage

    or 

    find a library in JS to do data vizualization and draw it


    in any case I want to replace the currently rendered component with a results page which shows the numbers and charts
    so also have to figure out conditional rendering or whatever the correct terminology is here 



    I anticipate this being very hard :(
