    1. Figure out how to run pyscript through JS
        a. Must then do so IFF the user clicks the ✅ button on the verification page

    3. Error handling/404 page to a an invalid ID in VerifyPlayer
    4. extract needed info from python script given the massive JSON
    5. place a spinner component as the rendered item with a little warning that it takes a few minutes as the main item
    6. when all data is retrieved & parsed, must then display desired data 
        a. This will be a layout & formatting challenge
    7. Draw charts


Flow:

2. verify if user is correct
3. if verified, begin running script
    a. put a spinny boi as the main component
    b. update periodically with status updates of where the script is at.

4. when finished output data returned from script  
    a. will need to add function that will send back all the data we need as JSON
    b. Figure out what to do for data vizualization
